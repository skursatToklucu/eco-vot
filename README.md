# Voting Frontend

This project is written in Next.js with tailwind css. This frontend serves as a few things:

1. The marketing side of a voting platform used to raise funds for a community crowd funded dota2 esports team.
2. The blog side of the voting platform to increase SEO and let people know what is going on
3. The actual voting and poll area including an authentication flow

TODO:

- Continue blog posts
- Limit polls and lazy load after 5 or 10
- Allow one poll to have its own page?

Emails:

- Create email template for newsletter (include unsubscribe link)
- Create an email template for a poll closing soon?

Post ideas:

(Make sure to internally link to different pages)

- Copy data from google docs about why people should make more
- Updates on where the DPC is
- Find player tweets/org tweets about not enough money in the DPC and talk about them and how we solve the problem
- Case studies on performance of people playing a game more hours and getting better at it
- Explain the logic behind why we should pay more money to players and less to valve
- Talk about when a team had to forfeit because players had jobs to do (bounty hunter team?)
