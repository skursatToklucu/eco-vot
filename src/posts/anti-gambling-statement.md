Esports has emerged as a global phenomenon with a dedicated fan base and lucrative sponsorship deals. However, one particular type of sponsor, betting companies, is a cause for concern. Betting sponsors have made their way into esports, and this is a worrying trend as research shows that betting sponsors contribute to gambling addiction, a problem that affects individuals and society as a whole.

## Gambling Addiction

Gambling addiction is a mental health disorder that affects individuals and their loved ones. The problem arises when a person becomes dependent on gambling to the point that it affects their daily life, work, and relationships. According to [Yale Medicine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/gambling-disorder), "two to 7% of youths develop a gambling disorder, compared with about 1% of adults, and many gambling disorders begin in adolescence". It can lead to financial difficulties, legal problems, and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety.

The impact of gambling addiction is not limited to the individual but extends to society. Gambling addiction leads to an increase in crime rates, homelessness, and a decrease in productivity. It also affects families and communities, leading to broken relationships and financial struggles. Therefore, it is essential to address the root causes of gambling addiction, including betting sponsors in esports.

## Tournament Winnings

Crowdfunding is a way for fans to help financially support their favorite teams without relying on gambling sponsors but it is not the only solution. Currently, most tournament winnings are awarded disproportionately to the winning team, leaving other teams with little to no compensation. This creates a disparity between the top teams and the rest, making it difficult for smaller teams to grow and succeed. Spreading tournament winnings across all competing teams and among different levels can help level (pun very much intended) the playing field and provide incentives for teams to compete, regardless of their size or ranking.

Crowdfunding an esports team and spreading tournament winnings can reduce the reliance on risky sponsors and help create a more equitable and sustainable esports industry. We must take a proactive approach to address gambling addiction and promote responsible gaming in esports.
